This project analyzes the global spread of COVID-19 using real-world datasets. It focuses on understanding how the virus impacted different countries over time and explores how economic factors like GDP per capita relate to the severity of infection spread.

The analysis includes:
	•	Cleaning and processing time-series COVID-19 case data
	•	Calculating the maximum daily infection rate for each country
	•	Merging COVID-19 data with GDP per capita data
	•	Creating scatterplots to visualize the relationship between GDP and infection rates (with log scaling for better comparison)
	•	Using Matplotlib for professional data visualizations

The goal of this project is to gain insights into how COVID-19 spread across countries.
